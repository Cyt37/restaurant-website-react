        Founded in 1974, Uncle Sammy has been serving the community for over 50
        years. What started as a small family-owned eatery has flourished into a
        local favorite thanks to our passion for fresh ingredients and
        time-honored recipes. Our mission is to bring people together over great
        food and warm hospitality.

        Specialties include artisan pizzas baked in our wood-fired oven,
        house-made pastas, and daily chef’s specials that highlight seasonal
        produce. Every dish is crafted using locally sourced ingredients
        whenever possible—this not only supports nearby farmers but also ensures
        the freshest possible flavors.

        Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply looking for a
        cozy dinner, our doors are always open. We believe good food unites
        families, friends, and neighbors, and we invite you to become part of
        our story.
